# Create and activate a virtual environment using miniconda
# If you have not already done so, create a 'workspace' at resources.web.cern.ch and increase its capacity to at least 20-50 GB
# cd <afs work directory: you need some disk space for this!>
wget https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh

# Clone the repository into your local directory
git clone https://github.com/SwapneelM/TrackingNtuples.git

# Change directory into where the data is stored
cd TrackingNtuples/TrackingNtuples/scripts

# Copy the extracted data into this directory and rename it for the notebook to use

# Run a Jupyter Notebook on LXPlus
# Any 5-digit port ID should work (for some reason 4-digit doesn't work)
# Obviously the upper limit is port ID 65535
# You may have to set a default password for jupyter using the commend 'jupyter notebook password'
# This will be the password you need to log into the jupyter notebook via a remote browser
jupyter notebook --ip=127.0.0.1 --no-browser --port=64002

# Now from your local machine run the following command
# ssh -nNT -L 127.0.0.1:10000:127.0.0.1:64002 [cern-username]@lxplus[number].cern.ch
# This tunnels the port 64002 on remote host lxplus to your machine's port 10000
# Then you can access access it on your web browser at '127.0.0.1:10000'
# Note that we can ideally replace '127.0.0.1' with 'localhost' if your `etc/hosts` file contains a line:
# 127.0.0.1               localhost localhost. 
# But in general, if you are not root you might not be able to modify these settings so stick with '127.0.0.1'
